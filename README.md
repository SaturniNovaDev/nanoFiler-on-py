# A file explorer built on Python with performance in mind.
This is a file explorer with a GUI built on tkinter I made with my co-worker @AndrewsVeloz as an experiment for building apps 
with Python, and also to get started on GitHub and Git, see other repos and do what the pros 
would do as well.

Remember I'm still new to coding, so it's no wonder the project's structure might not be as 
cool as other projects'.

If you could contribute to this repo and teach me the ropes to GitHub on the way, I would be 
very grateful.
